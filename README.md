# Schoology-Like-Bot
This set of scripts is designed to automatically like Schoology posts as quickly as possible. While it is not necessarily faster than a human who receives contemporary notification of a Schoology post, it has two major advantages:
* The Schoology Like Bot, unlike humans, is never occupied by anything that would prevent it from liking a post.
* Some versions of the Schoology Like Bot do not rely on Schoology's often-delayed notification system, allowing it to know of a Schoology before any human who is not constantly refreshing their Schoology feed.
